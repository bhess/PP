Scenarios
-------------
A. Scenario with a simplified supply chain:
	- supply chain structure: N partners organized as binary tree.
	- product flow: equally loaded, same IOLT and OILT for all partners, same shipping instants
	A1:
	- adversary model: No clones
	A2:
	- adversary model: One counterfeits entry point - Sniffing at one branch of first binary division, injecting in the other one.
	A3:
	- adversary model: Multiple counterfeits entry points - Sniffing at both branch of first binary division, randomly injecting in the others.
	
	
B. Scenario with a semi real-world supply chain:
	- supply chain structure: N partners organized as ....
	- product flow: .....
	B1:
	- adversary model: No clones
	B2:
	- adversary model: One counterfeits entry point.
	B3:
	- adversary model: Multiple counterfeits entry points.

Evaluation
-------------
All the following parameters will produce a graph "Metrics[] vs. parameter". A representation "Hit rate vs. False alarm rate" (aka ROC) varying parameter is also possible.

1. Without clones: Scenario A1 and B1
	a. 	- Varying: T
	b. 	- Varying: Pmr

2. With clones: Scenario A2, A3, B2, B3
	a. 	- Varying: Threshold
	b. 	- Varying: Pmr
	c.  - Varying: ratio between genuine and cloned tag	

3. With clones: Scenario A2, A3
	d.  - Varying: ratio between IOLT and OILT
	e.  - Varying: SC structure
	f.  - Varying: Counterfeit entry point (A2 only)
